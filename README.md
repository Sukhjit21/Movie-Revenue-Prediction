# Movie-Popularity-Prediction

### Introduction
For this project, we will be looking at the top 10,000 most popular movies from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-AU). Our goal is to build a model that will predict the popularity of a movie based on key attributes including but not limited to budget, genres, & revenue.
